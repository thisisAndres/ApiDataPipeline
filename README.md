# ApiDataPipeline Sumary

Utilizing Azure native technologies such as Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Azure Data Lake, Synapse, and Power BI, this project aims to build a robust data pipeline. The pipeline will consume data from an API on a daily basis, transform the data using Databricks, and store it in Azure Synapse for advanced analysis and visualization with Power BI.
